Relationships:
An employee can belong to only one department, but a department can have many employees (One-to-Many).
An employee can hold one job position, but a job position can be held by multiple employees (One-to-Many).
An employee can be assigned to multiple projects, and a project can have multiple employees working on it (Many-to-Many).
Payroll is tied to a specific employee, generated monthly.
Attendance records daily check-ins/check-outs for employees.
Leave management tracks employee leaves.
Performance evaluations are carried out by supervisors for individual employees.
Training keeps track of employee development.
Recruitment tracks the hiring process for each job position.
Employee roles are for defining access control, and roles can have different permissions across the system.
Optional Enhancements:
Audit Logs for tracking all system changes (who did what and when).
Document Management for storing important employee documents (e.g., offer letters, ID proofs).
Self-service portals for employees to view their attendance, payroll, apply for leaves, and so on.
